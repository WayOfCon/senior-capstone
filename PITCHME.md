@snapend

Historical context

- dynasty before
- dynasty after
- dynasty in comparison to all
  - golden age

---
Historical context

- golden age
  - poetry
  - art

---
Wang wei exemplar

- decided to focus on one person because tang dynasty not just about poetry
  - complete oeuvre
    - wang wei as a artist, poet, and the inseparable connection between the two
      - pioneered scholars painting?
        - black and white, "breaking the brush"?

---
art (wang wei)

- probably more than one slide

---
difficulties in understanding/translating chinese classical poetry in general

- needs probably a few slides

---
looking at one or two specific poems and breaking them down, explaining difficulties along the way

- a handful of slides per poem

---
wrap-up

questions
