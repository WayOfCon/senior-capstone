- **Before**
- Leading up
- 漢朝 collapses
- Unified under Suí Dynasty
- Very Short
- Groundwork

@snapend

Note:

- Leading up to the Suí Dynasty:
- Collapse of the Hàn dynasty in 220 CE
- 3 centuries of division and fragmentation
- Then, unified under the Suí dynasty
- Only 37 years because:
- second Sui emperor engaged in unsuccessful wars and vast public works, such as the Grand Canal linking the north and south, that exhausted the people and caused them to revolt.
- political and governmental institutions of the sui dynasty lay the groundwork for tang dynasty

### 唐朝  Táng Dynasty
@snapend

@snap[west list-content-verbose span-100]
<br>
@ul[list-bullets-circles]
- **Early 8th Century**
- The dynasty reached the peak of its wealth and power during the early 8th century,
- It is rightfully ranked as the classical period of Chinese art and literature, as it set the high standard to which later poets, painters, and sculptors aspired. The expressions and images contained in the poems of Li Bo (701–762) and Du Fu (712–770) reflect the flamboyant lives of the court and the conflicting sentiments generated by military campaigns. The vigorous brushwork of the court painter Wu Daozi, (689-after 755), and the naturalist idiom of the poet and painter Wang Wei, (699–759), became artistic paradigms for later generations

- **After**
- An Lushan rebellion

@ulend
@snapend

Note:

- An Lushan rebellion mid-8th century
- not until 818 CE emperor Xianzong restored authority
- by mid-9th century government power grew weaker
- fractured into independent kingdoms in 907 CE

Historical context

- golden age
  - poetry
  - art


---
Wang wei exemplar

- decided to focus on one person because tang dynasty not just about poetry
  - complete oeuvre
    - wang wei as a artist, poet, and the inseparable connection between the two
      - pioneered scholars painting?
        - black and white, "breaking the brush"?


---
art (wang wei)

- probably more than one slide


---
difficulties in understanding/translating chinese classical poetry in general

- needs probably a few slides


---
looking at one or two specific poems and breaking them down, explaining difficulties along the way

- a handful of slides per poem


---
wrap-up
