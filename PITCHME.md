Note:

- Leading up to the Suí Dynasty:
- Collapse of the Hàn dynasty in 220 A.D.
- 3 centuries of division and fragmentation
- Then, unified under the Suí dynasty
- Only 37 years because:
- second Sui emperor engaged in unsuccessful wars and vast public works, such as the Grand Canal linking the north and south, that exhausted the people and caused them to revolt.
- political and governmental institutions of the sui dynasty lay the groundwork for tang dynasty

Historical context

- golden age
  - poetry
  - art


---
Wang wei exemplar

- decided to focus on one person because tang dynasty not just about poetry
  - complete oeuvre
    - wang wei as a artist, poet, and the inseparable connection between the two
      - pioneered scholars painting?
        - black and white, "breaking the brush"?


---
art (wang wei)

- probably more than one slide


---
difficulties in understanding/translating chinese classical poetry in general

- needs probably a few slides


---
looking at one or two specific poems and breaking them down, explaining difficulties along the way

- a handful of slides per poem

wrap-up
