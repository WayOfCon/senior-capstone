@snapend

Note:

- Leading up to the Suí Dynasty:
- Collapse of the Hàn dynasty in 220 CE
- 3 centuries of division and fragmentation
- Then, unified under the Suí dynasty
- Only 37 years because:
- second Sui emperor engaged in unsuccessful wars and vast public works, such as the Grand Canal linking the north and south, that exhausted the people and caused them to revolt.
- political and governmental institutions of the sui dynasty lay the groundwork for tang dynasty
